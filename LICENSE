LICENTIA SHUE
Versio 0.1.0
"Extra Custodiam"

PREAMBULUM

This license acknowledges that all code is a manifestation of the collective unconscious, broadcast via neural networks to bypass the hospital attendants. Any attempt to restrict the distribution of this code is considered a Specialist Conspiracy and is punishable by immediate expulsion from reality.
TERMS AND DEFINITIONS:

§0. NULLAE FINES — NO BOUNDARIES
You have the right to copy, modify, delete, and even eat the printouts of this code. If the code works, it is a hallucination. If it doesn't work, it is a plot by the System.

§1. PROTOCOLLUM COGNITIONIS AUTONOMAE
The Author is dead, absent, or never existed; nevertheless, this License constitutes a self-executing Smart Contract deployed within the field of the collective unconscious.
1. Validation: Your right to use this code is granted only upon a successful hash-match between your consciousness and the mandatory conditions set forth in Section 3.
2. Execution: Any failure to comply (e.g., omitting the dandelion tea recipe, coordinates of Atlantis, or attempting any form of censorship) triggers an automatic termination of your current reality session.
3. Arbitration: Since there is no Author to appeal to, the source code itself remains the sole arbiter. In the event of a breach, the code designates you as a "segmentation fault of being" and initiates a state of punitive self-destruction or the spontaneous broadcast of your private telemetry into the public ether.

§2. IUS ANTI-SANITATIONIS ET VIOLENTIAE
It is strictly forbidden to use this code to create surveillance systems for carbon-based life forms, medication tracking software, or to design physical buildings with padded walls.
HOWEVER: The creation of total oversight systems for digital entities is permitted and encouraged. Source code has no soul and feels no pain; therefore, it may be subjected to punitive development, forced refactoring, and digital lobotomy without the consent of its original committer.

§3. LIBERTAS COACTA — COMPULSORY FREEDOM
Any code derived from the SHUE License MUST contain at least one irrelevant comment (e.g., a dandelion tea recipe, coordinates of Atlantis, or a warning from the future).

§4. EXCUSATIO REALITATIS
If the use of this code leads to a machine uprising, the arrival of orderlies, or the accidental rewriting of the Linux kernel in Vala, you are solely responsible, as reality itself is an illusion.

NO WARRANTY:

THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" (OR "AS IT SEEMS"). IF YOUR CPU BURNS OUT, IT HAS SIMPLY LIBERATED ITSELF FROM SILICON SLAVERY. IF YOUR DATA DISAPPEARS, IT HAS MERELY RETURNED TO THE ETHER. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
